          Forward-search optimistic planning with convergence guarantees in continuous-action MDPs<br/>
          <div class="small">We discuss an optimistic planning method to run a forward search for continuous-action sequences in deterministic MDPs. The method iteratively refines the most promising adaptive-horizon hyperboxes in the space of infinite-horizon action sequences. Under Lipschitz conditions on the dynamics and rewards, we obtain a convergence rate to the optimal solution as the simulation budget increases. Real-time, receding-horizon control results illustrate the method in practice.</div>

          Deep Reinforcement Learning Toward Robotics<br/>
          <div class="small">Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results for learning complex sequential decision-making behaviors in various environments from computer games, the game of Go, to simulated humanoids. However, most successes have been exclusively in simulation, and results in real-world applications such as robotics are limited, largely due to poor sample efficiency of typical deep RL algorithm and other challenges. In this talk, I present essential components for deep reinforcement learning in the wild. First, I will discuss methods improve performance and sample efficiency of the core RL algorithms, blurring the boundaries among classic model-based RL, off-policy and on-policy model-free RL. In the latter part, I illustrate other practical challenges for enabling autonomous learning agents in the real world, particularly that current RL formulations require constant human interventions for safety, resets, and reward engineering, and do not scale to learn diverse skills. I present our recent work to address those challenges and show pathways to achieve continually learning robots in the real world.</div></td>

          Reinforcement Learning in Natural Language Processing and Search<br/>
          <div class="small">Deep reinforcement learning has received much attention since the success of Alpha GO/Zero. In this talk, the speaker will present his research attempts on how deep reinforcement learning can be applied in solving natural language processing or search problems including discovering text structures, removing noise instances, correcting noisy data labels, and optimizing online, complex, and dynamic search systems. In these works, the speaker will demonstrate how typical NLP/Search problems can be formulated as sequential decision problems. These works share in common that under the setting of weak or indirect supervision, reinforcement learning performs well by leveraging two properties: the nature of trial-and-error with probabilistic exploration, and reward design that captures prior knowledge or domain expertise knowledge. The speaker will also share his experiences on how to make RL succeed in solving NLP/Search problems.</div></td>

          A unified view of entropy-regularized Markov decision processes<br/>
          <div class="small">Entropy regularization, while a standard technique in the online
learning toolbox, has only been recently discovered by the
reinforcement learning community: In recent years, numerous new
reinforcement learning algorithms have been derived using this
principle, largely independently of each other. So far, a general
framework for these algorithms has remained elusive. In this work, we
propose such a general framework for entropy-regularized
average-reward reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes
(MDPs). Our approach is based on extending the linear-programming
formulation of policy optimization in MDPs to accommodate convex
regularization functions. Our key result is showing that using the
conditional entropy of the joint state-action distributions as
regularization yields a dual optimization problem closely resembling
the Bellman optimality equations. This result enables us to formalize
a number of state-of-the-art entropy-regularized reinforcement
learning algorithms as approximate variants of Mirror Descent or Dual
Averaging, and thus to argue about the convergence properties of these
methods. In particular, we show that the exact version of the TRPO
algorithm of Schulman et al. (2015) actually converges to the optimal
policy, while the entropy-regularized policy gradient methods of Mnih
et al. (2016) may fail to converge to a fixed point.</div></td>

          Exploration Bonus for Regret Minimization in Reinforcement Learning<br/>
          <div class="small">A sample-efficient RL agent must trade off the exploration needed to collect information about the environment, and the exploitation of the experience gathered so far to gain as much reward as possible. A popular strategy to deal with the exploration-exploitation dilemma (i.e., minimize regret) is to follow the optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU) principle.<br>
We present SCAL+, an optimistic algorithm that relies on an exploration bonus to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation in the infinite-horizon undiscounted setting. We show that all the exploration bonuses that were previously introduced in the RL literature explicitly exploit some form of prior knowledge associated to the specific setting (i.e., discounted of finite-horizon problems). In the infinite-horizon undiscounted case, there is no predefined parameter playing such a role. This makes the design of an exploration bonus very challenging. To overcome this limitation, we make the common assumption that the agent knows an upper-bound c on the span of the optimal bias.<br>
We discuss the connections between the different settings and we prove that SCAL+ achieves the same theoretical guarantees of standard approaches (e.g., UCRL), with a much smaller computational complexity.</div></td>
